# Summary
This projects builds a network analysis platform by using ```NetworkX``` and ```cugraph``` that can be used to explore and summarize any network you come across. The inputs of the platform include edgelist, vertices, subgraph and the boolean variable indicating whether or not the network is directed. The implemented functions include but not limited to degree distribution, reciprocity_distribution, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, clossness centrality, diameter, clustering coeefficient, community dection with Girvan-Newman algorithm, etc.

An example of the platform is shown in the notebook by analyzing the social network of actors who have acted in blockbuster movies (with 100000 reviews in a [movie database website](https://www.douban.com/).
